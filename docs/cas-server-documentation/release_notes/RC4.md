# 7.0.0-RC4 Release Notes

We strongly recommend that you take advantage of the release candidates as they come out. Waiting for a `GA` release is only going to set
you up for unpleasant surprises. A `GA` is [a tag and nothing more](https://apereo.github.io/2017/03/08/the-myth-of-ga-rel/). Note
that CAS releases are *strictly* time-based releases; they are not scheduled or based on specific benchmarks,
statistics or completion of features. To gain confidence in a particular
release, it is strongly recommended that you start early by experimenting with release candidates and/or follow-up snapshots.

## Apereo Membership

If you benefit from Apereo CAS as free and open-source software, we invite you
to [join the Apereo Foundation](https://www.apereo.org/content/apereo-membership)
and financially support the project at a capacity that best suits your deployment. Note that all development activity is performed
*almost exclusively* on a voluntary basis with no expectations, commitments or strings attached. Having the financial means to better
sustain engineering activities will allow the developer community to allocate *dedicated and committed* time for long-term support,
maintenance and release planning, especially when it comes to addressing critical and security issues in a timely manner.

## Get Involved

- Start your CAS deployment today. Try out features and [share feedback](/cas/Mailing-Lists.html).
- Better yet, [contribute patches](/cas/developer/Contributor-Guidelines.html).
- Suggest and apply documentation improvements.

## Resources

- [Release Schedule](https://github.com/apereo/cas/milestones)

## System Requirements

The JDK baseline requirement for this CAS release is and **MUST** be JDK `17`. All compatible distributions
such as Amazon Corretto, Zulu, Eclipse Temurin, etc should work and are implicitly supported.

## New & Noteworthy

The following items are new improvements and enhancements presented in this release.

### SAML2 Delegated Authentication Metadata

SAML2 service provider metadata used and managed during [delegated authentication](../integration/Delegate-Authentication-SAML.html)
can now be stored in relational databases.

### Testing Strategy

The collection of end-to-end browser tests based on Puppeteer continue to grow to cover more use cases
and scenarios. At the moment, total number of jobs stands at approximately `378` distinct scenarios. The overall
test coverage of the CAS codebase is approximately `94%`.

### Authentication Geolocation via Maxmind

Geolocating authentication requests via Maxmind can now support [Maxmind Web Services](../authentication/GeoTracking-Authentication-Requests.html).

## Other Stuff

- The session cookie (typically and by default named `DISSESSION`) typically used for distributed session management can now be signed and encrypted in 
  scenarios where CAS is acting as an OAUTH or OpenID Connect provider, or is delegating authentication to an external identity provider.
